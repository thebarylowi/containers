# containers
Projet will contain basic containers to use in separate projeects (it will be able to compile it to a static lib and add to projects). It is created to practice C++ and unit test development.

I will build this project using TDD to practice this technique (google test and googel mocks frameworks will be used).

It is needed to clone googletest framework (https://github.com/google/googletest) into googletest directory - is it possible to avoid it?!
